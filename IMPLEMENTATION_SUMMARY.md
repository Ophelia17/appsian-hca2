# Implementation Summary

## Completed Milestones

### ✅ 1. Repo Scaffold & Tooling
- Created `.gitignore` for .NET and Node.js
- Set up project structure with `server/` and `client/` directories
- Configured TypeScript strict mode and ESLint for client

### ✅ 2. Server Scaffold
- Created .NET 8 Web API project
- Configured Entity Framework Core with SQLite
- Set up DbContext with proper entity relationships
- Configured migrations and database initialization

### ✅ 3. Entities/DTOs
- Implemented all entities: `User`, `Project`, `TaskItem`, `RefreshToken`
- Created DTOs for all operations: RegisterDto, LoginDto, CreateProjectDto, etc.
- Added proper validation attributes

### ✅ 4. Auth Implementation
- Implemented user registration with email uniqueness check
- Implemented login with password verification
- Configured JWT token generation with 60-minute expiry
- Password hashing using SHA-256

### ✅ 5. Refresh Tokens
- Database-backed refresh token storage
- Token rotation on refresh
- Token revocation on logout
- SHA-256 hashing of refresh tokens

### ✅ 6. Project CRUD
- GET /api/projects - List user's projects
- GET /api/projects/{id} - Get project with embedded tasks
- POST /api/projects - Create project
- DELETE /api/projects/{id} - Delete project
- All operations enforce ownership checks

### ✅ 7. Task CRUD
- POST /api/projects/{projectId}/tasks - Create task
- PUT /api/tasks/{taskId} - Update task
- DELETE /api/tasks/{taskId} - Delete task
- All operations enforce ownership via project ownership

### ✅ 8. Server Tests
- Created test project with xUnit
- Implemented integration tests for auth flow
- Added tests for full CRUD operations
- Tests for validation and error cases

### ✅ 9. Client Scaffold
- Vite + React + TypeScript setup
- React Router configuration
- Axios setup with interceptors
- React Bootstrap integration

### ✅ 10. Auth Pages
- Login page with form validation
- Register page with password requirements
- Token storage in localStorage
- Axios interceptor for automatic token refresh
- Protected route guard implementation

### ✅ 11. Dashboard
- Project listing with cards
- Create project form
- Delete project with confirmation
- Toast notifications for feedback
- Logout functionality

### ✅ 12. Project Details
- Fetch and display project with tasks
- Create task form
- Task completion toggle
- Delete task functionality
- Proper navigation between pages
